- Fix the DockInfo problem when DockAreas area changes.
  + The problem is: A DockBar, when it's docked, holds a custom DockInfo 
    from the DockArea where it was docked. If you change the kind of
    DockAreas, the DockInfo is a type of DockInfo for the old DockArea
    kind.
  + Example:
    A DockBar is docked in a BasicDockArea, floatOut() the DockBar, we
    change to BandedDockArea, double click in its title (to dock the
    bar) FATAL ERROR: the held DockInfo in the DockBar is for
    BasicDockInfo, not for BandedDockInfo!!!
  + The solution could be to delete all DockInfos from all DockBars
    when we changes the DockAreas.
  + This error is possible only in the example (in the real life, an
    application should never change the DockAreas)
