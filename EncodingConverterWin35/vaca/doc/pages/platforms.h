@li Compiled with MSVC 9.0 (2008 Express) and MinGW (GCC 3.4.2 and 4.4) using CMake 2.6-patch 3.

@section page_platforms_portability Portability

An aim with Vaca is to wrap so much the Win32 API that the common user
should not see or know nothing about it. This principle is a sign to
make Vaca portable. A possible platform to port Vaca in the future
is GTK+.
